      <description>The first part in this series on Reflection in C++ gave a high level overview of many of the possibilities open to you when adding reflection to your games. In this second part I&#39;m going to go into details and cover the system used to aid the rendering engine in Splinter Cell: Conviction (SC5).
The motivation for the development of the SC5 engine was a clean break from the past. We were working with a very, very large code base that used Unreal 2.</description>

      <description>If there was one job I&#39;d love to do other than writing games it&#39;d be writing compilers. This probably explains my obsession with the subject of reflection; a topic I&#39;ve been hammering away at for almost 10 years now. Having written a few compilers in the past, it became glaringly obvious to me that reflection would be quite simple to add to C++ -- if you&#39;re willing to place some limits on it -- and that the language has suffered from its absence.</description>
